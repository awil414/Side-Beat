# Side-Beat

## Find local music shows similar to your favorite artists

## Description
With the use of 3rd Party APIs, Side Beat allows users to input an artist they like, returns a list of similar artists, and a link to purchase their show tickets from SeatGeek. This app was developed so concert-seekers can still experience the live music style they enjoy when their favorite artist isn't available. When users enter a zip code they can also find an additional list of upcoming shows in their area.

Similar artist data is fetched using 3rd Party API, Taste Dive and links to those artists' upcoming shows are then generated from the SeatGeek API.

 ## Usage
Users enter an artist name or band name in the Search bar and click "Search". A list of similar artists will display underneath. When a user clicks on any of the similar artists, that artist's SeatGeek page will open showing if there are upcoming concerts in the user's area, along with all upcoming shows and the ability to purchase tickets. Once they have selected an artist's name, it will be saved to local storage and displayed on the page. As an additional feature, a user can enter any zip code to see if there are upcoming shows in that area.

 ## Roadmap
Create variables for what data we need and what input we will take. 
Create page structure some HTML. 
Create fetch functions to pull similar artists through Taste Dive API.
Take Taste Dive data and allow that to compare data through ticket master API that will then pull up events.
Recheck page structure and style
Create function for creating elements to list out the data. 
Recheck page structure again with style.
