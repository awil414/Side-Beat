# Sing-A-Like

## Find local music shows similar to favorite artists

## Description
Sing-A-Like allows users to input an artist they like, and then returns a list of similar artists playing in their area, along with a link to purchase their show tickets from Seatgeek. This app was developed so concert-seekers can still experience the live music style they enjoy without having to wait for a local tour. Users can find local shows within a mile radius that are similiar to their favorite artists.

 ## Roadmap
Create variables for what data we need and what input we will take. 
Create page structure some HTML. 
Create fetch functions to pull similar artists through Taste Dive API.
Take Taste Dive data and allow that to compare data through ticket master API that will then pull up events.
Recheck page structure and style
Create function for creating elements to list out the data. 
Recheck page structure again with style.
